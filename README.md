# 🚨 Online Fraud Detection Model Running

An intelligent Machine Learning-based fraud detection system designed to identify suspicious online financial transactions in real time. This project demonstrates the complete workflow of a fraud detection pipeline — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Online financial fraud has become one of the biggest challenges in digital banking and payment systems. This project uses Machine Learning techniques to analyze transaction patterns and classify whether a transaction is **fraudulent** or **legitimate**.

The system is trained using a highly imbalanced real-world inspired fraud detection dataset and applies preprocessing, balancing, and classification techniques to improve fraud detection accuracy.

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains transaction-related information such as:

| Feature          | Description                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `step`           | Time step of the transaction        |
| `type`           | Type of transaction                 |
| `amount`         | Amount transferred                  |
| `nameOrig`       | Sender account                      |
| `oldbalanceOrg`  | Sender balance before transaction   |
| `newbalanceOrig` | Sender balance after transaction    |
| `nameDest`       | Receiver account                    |
| `oldbalanceDest` | Receiver balance before transaction |
| `newbalanceDest` | Receiver balance after transaction  |
| `isFraud`        | Fraud label (0 = Legit, 1 = Fraud)  |
